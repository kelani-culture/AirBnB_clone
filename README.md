Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! we aim to deploy a simplified version of the Airbnb website.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to cover fundamental concepts of higher-level programming by implementing a subset of Airbnb's features. After four months of development, the project will consist of the following components:

1. **Command Interpreter:** A console-based tool that manipulates data without a visual interface, providing a Shell-like environment. This will be crucial for development and debugging purposes.

2. **Website (Front-end):** A web interface showcasing the final product to users, featuring both static and dynamic components.

3. **Data Storage:** A database or files that store objects. The data model and manipulation will be handled by the console and the API.

4. **API:** An API that acts as a communication interface between the front-end and data. It will handle operations like retrieval, creation, deletion, and updating of objects.

## Project Components

### The Console

- The console will be responsible for managing objects through a command interpreter.
- It will facilitate tasks such as creating, updating, and destroying objects.
- Objects will be stored and persisted in a JSON file, abstracting away the storage details.

### Data Model

- Before proceeding, we'll design and create a data model that represents the essential entities of our project.
- This model will guide how objects are structured and how they interact with each other.

### Storage Abstraction

- We will implement a storage engine that separates the way objects are manipulated from how they're stored.
- This abstraction allows us to switch storage types without modifying the entire codebase.

### Team Collaboration

- This project involves a team of two: Darasimi kelani and Daniel Emmanuel.
- Regular communication and collaboration will be key to its success.
- We will work together to develop and validate the storage engine and console.

Happy coding!
